This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router when combining `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` within a single page component.  The expected behavior is that only one of these functions should execute. However, this example shows that both can run (resulting in unexpected behavior), causing issues with data fetching and hydration.  The solution involves clarifying which data fetching method is appropriate and refactoring the code accordingly.
